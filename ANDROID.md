# Android — sharing Swift the OpenZCine way

OpenPocketCine’s Android app lives in this repository (`Apps/Android/`,
`Sources/OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade/`). Closed testing is the TestFlight analog:
signed AAB from GitHub Actions onto Play, waitlist on
[openpocketcine.app](https://openpocketcine.app/). iOS is the daily driver. Setup:
[`docs/android-play-ci.md`](docs/android-play-ci.md).

Business logic stays in **`OpenPocketViewCore`** (UI-free, I/O-free Foundation).
Android follows the public [OpenZCine](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenZCine)
pattern rather than Skip/SKIE/an xcframework.

Operator-visible behavior lives in [`docs/PARITY.md`](docs/PARITY.md). Live UDP
and decoder invariants live in [`docs/live-session.md`](docs/live-session.md).
This file is the Android build and I/O notes that implement those rows.

## How the Android build is structured

Source: the public [OpenZCine](https://github.com/erik-sutton95/OpenZCine) repository.

1. **Portable Swift core** — `Sources/OpenPocketViewCore/` never imports SwiftUI, UIKit, or Android.
2. **Android JNI facade** — `Sources/OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade/` owns the session that talks to the camera on Android, plus hand-written `@_cdecl` JNI shims (`SwiftCoreJNI.swift`). A header-only `CJNI` target exposes NDK `<jni.h>` on Android only.
3. **Cross-compile, don’t SPM-link** — Gradle task `:app:stageSwiftCore` (`just android-core`, `scripts/android-stage-swift-core.sh`) builds `aarch64-unknown-linux-android29` and stages `libOpenPocketCineAndroid.so` plus the Swift runtime `.so` closure into generated jniLibs. **arm64-v8a only.** Toolchain pin: Swift **6.3.3** + `swift-6.3.3-RELEASE_android`.
4. **Kotlin seam** — `Apps/Android/core-api` defines `CameraSession` / `CameraIdentity` interfaces. The Compose app implements them with `SwiftCoreCameraSession` over JNI. Kotlin does not pack protocol bytes.
5. **Same applicationId as iOS bundle** (`com.opencapture.openpocketcine`). Design tokens are duplicated as floats in `Theme.kt` / `pairing/StartupDesign.kt` so connection screens match.

iOS links the core via Swift Package Manager. Android does **not** consume that SPM product at runtime — only the cross-compiled `.so`.

The optional GigaScan stitch engine is a separate Rust artifact. Gradle stages
`liblumia_gigascan_core.so` from `LUMIA_GIGASCAN_CORE_DIR` or the sibling
repository's arm64 release directory. `LumiaGigaScanCoreBridge` calls its
versioned JSON C ABI through `liblumia_gigascan_jni.so`; it does not add stitch
code to `OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade` or couple the camera protocol core to
Rust.

## Pocket mapping

| Piece | OpenPocketCine |
| --- | --- |
| Portable Swift core | `OpenPocketViewCore` (DUML, HEVC depacketizer, saved-camera records, connection phase) |
| JNI facade | `OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade`: BLE/Wi-Fi/UDP session that calls the core, JNI surface for scan/connect/live-frame callbacks |
| `core-api` | Kotlin `CameraSession` wrapping the facade |
| Compose shell | Splash + saved cameras + Osmo connection wizard using the same `StartupColors` / `BrandColors` floats as iOS |
| Saved cameras | `SharedPreferences` file `openpocketcine.saved-cameras`, key `records-json`. Wi-Fi passwords stay out of prefs (re-read over BLE, same as iOS) |
| applicationId | `com.opencapture.openpocketcine` on iOS and Android |

## Do not copy from OpenZCine Android

Nikon PTP-IP, AccessorySetupKit / `NIKON_ZR_*` SSIDs, multi-setup path chips, OCR SSID scanner, USB-C/HDMI paths, monitor assist tools.

## First Android milestone

Done in-tree (see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)):

1. Same Swift Android SDK pin OpenZCine uses (6.3.3).
2. `OpenPocketCineAndroidFacade` + `CJNI` in `Package.swift` (`#if os(Android)` JNI).
3. Gradle `:app:stageSwiftCore` stages `libOpenPocketCineAndroid.so`.
4. Compose splash → empty-store wizard / saved list → live HEVC (MediaCodec) using enable-once + ACK pump.

## Android I/O notes

How this shell implements [`docs/PARITY.md`](docs/PARITY.md). Contract language stays there.

### Connection

`bindProcessToNetwork` then UDP `0.0.0.0:0` after `Network.bindSocket`. A local
VPN (AdGuard / Blokada / RethinkDNS) that did not `allowBypass()` still owns
the process — do not add another bind path (#239). MediaCodec
uses wall-clock PTS and `KEY_LOW_LATENCY`; do not pace at 30 fps. Cached Wi-Fi
creds sit in private prefs, not saved-camera JSON. `holdsMonitor` must not latch
a forever skip after a SoftAP flap. `isProcessBound` stays true while
reassociation grace is armed (the `Network` object may already be null).
Handshake miss is `DatalinkError.NoHandshake` (iOS `DatalinkError.noHandshake`),
not Kotlin `error()`. Session recovery catches it; `cameraSoftAPDecision` JNI is
the production `CameraSoftAP` ladder.

### Live picture

Vulkan (`libopc_vulkan.so`) when init succeeds: MediaCodec → `ImageReader`
AHardwareBuffer → YCbCr convert 1:1 at the 720p HEVC raster (sampling 4:2:0
at panel size is the Adreno mosaic). The Rec.709 cube is a 3D texture
(`CIColorCube`); a 2D blue-slice atlas bled across tiles and blotched
D-Log2. Cube at 720p, then stretch Rec.709 (iOS `bakeSize` then bilinear).
Cubing after the upsample blotched D-Log2 vs iOS. Peaking / scopes / face
stay on 720p RGB.
Peaking is the GLES 3-pass (vertical re-blur, mask, closed
stroke) on the unmanaged 720p RGB, then composited over the grade.
Assists-off is the 720p RGB blit. GLES
`FeedEffectsGlProgram` on `GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES` is the fallback. Settings and the media library
cover the monitor; they must not drop pktType `0x02` ingest (parity: live
HEVC held). API 34+ SurfaceView stays attached while that overlay covers it
(`SURFACE_LIFECYCLE_FOLLOWS_ATTACHMENT`) — visibility-follow destroyed the
swapchain on S25 and left a black well while UDP stayed live (#248). A
failed swapchain attach retries; it is not a GLES fallback.
The decoder ImageReader is created in the Vulkan session constructor
(same tick as LIVE). `nativeCreate` runs on `opc.vk.gpu` and compiles
only YCbCr copy + blit — `feed.frag` waits until after the first
picture. Compiling the LUT pipes on the ImageReader thread missed
`0x09/0xa8` and left WAITING FOR LIVE VIEW up 5–10 s. Present never
waits forever on the GPU fence. LUT stretch is the blit of the 720p
bake. Each present acquires the AHB from `FOREIGN_EXT` and
releases it after the 720p YCbCr copy — a missing release left static
skip-blocks in the GPU cache until motion overwrote them.

Return-from-gallery uses `restartLiveViewAfterMedia` (captured live-start),
not `DatalinkDriver.startLiveView` alone. Drop the swapchain in
`surfaceDestroyed` before Android destroys the window mutex; drain
`opc.vk.img` before `nativeDestroy`. Contract: [`docs/live-session.md`](docs/live-session.md).

### HUD glass

Kyant `AndroidLiquidGlass` on API 33+ / ≥4 GB devices that are not
`isLowRamDevice`. FULL stays FULL (no frame-budget demote). Kyant cannot sample
a SurfaceView. Do not blit a PixelCopy over the well — that 20 Hz nearest copy
became the picture (S25 mosaic). Pairing, Operator Setup, and media list rows
stay solid fills.

### Assists GPU

Assists-off is one YCbCr blit of the MediaCodec AHB (hardware `c2.qti` / Exynos
HEVC, not `c2.android`). LUT / FALSE / ZEBRA / PEAK add the 3D-cube grade pass.
WAVE / PARADE /
VECTOR / HISTO tap a 200-wide downsample (213×120 on 720p) at 25 Hz
(10 Hz with three or more scopes) and paint in Compose Canvas.
Face AF samples unmanaged 720p RGB at 640×360 through ML Kit Face
Detection (Vision-class, 3/4 views) — not `android.media.FaceDetector`
and not a PixelCopy of the swapchain (that copy is already mirrored
when TT180/MIRROR is on, and the overlay mirrors again). Lock requires
an eye landmark (iOS `FaceStructurePolicy`); ML Kit tracking IDs stay
off so `FaceTrackHold` owns persistence.
WAVE / PARADE accumulate into a 250×153 bitmap off the UI thread; VECTOR uses
the 128-bin raster.

### Media decode

Playback grades the 720p LRF/XRF proxy in GLES (ExoPlayer → OES → TextureView).
Share / Save to Photos caches the original (`MediaHTTP.deliveryPath`).
Playback cache streams LRF/XRF (and originals) to disk (`downloadFile`).
`fetchBytes` is thumbs/SCR only and is capped at 8 MiB — a missing
Content-Length must not grow a `ByteArrayOutputStream` until OOM (#188).

## OpenZCine Android patterns adopted

Not Nikon PTP/USB/Wear/OCR:

- Keystore AES/GCM Wi-Fi password store (`CameraWifiCredentialStore`)
- `WIFI_MODE_FULL_LOW_LATENCY` lock while live
- In-app-gated operator haptics
- AAR `compileSdk` 37 metadata gate disabled so the project stays on SDK 36
- Shared `CubeLUT` packer (`LUTLibraryWire`) for GLES-ready RGBA cubes
- GLES ES2 feed-effect shaders under `assets/shaders/`
- Media cache complete-at-exact-length + `noBackupFilesDir`
- Sticky `ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED` readout instead of a 1 Hz poll
